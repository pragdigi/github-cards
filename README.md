### Thanks to create-react-app for the build tool and jsComplete for the example

In this project, I will attempt to create a GitHub Cards app which will take information from the public GitHub API and allow the user to add users to a list to display their information in the App.

To challenge myself, I will extend this application to further test my skills and ensure i'm progressing with my learning. Once I decide how I'm going to extend the application, I will update the README.

Issues with code
1. Error handling is not present (invalid input, network problems, request timeout/long)
2. axios used, swap to agent instead
3. extract logic which manages username state 
4. probably can update these classes to functions 

Planned updates
~~1. swap out axios for a agent(swapped for function fetch call)~~ 
2. add error handling
3. autocomplete
