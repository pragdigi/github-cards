### Thanks to create-react-app for the build tool and jsComplete for the example

In this project, I will attempt to create a GitHub Cards app which will take information from the public GitHub API and allow the user to add users to a list to display their information in the App.

To challenge myself, I will extend this application to further challenge my skills and learning. Once I decide how I'm going to extend the application will update the README.
